[![Flutter Desktop Deployment](https://github.com/Zingo21/github_client/actions/workflows/flutter-desktop-deployment.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Zingo21/github_client/actions/workflows/flutter-desktop-deployment.yml)

A Flutter desktop app to access your GitHub repositories.

#### I also use a local plugin called [window_to_front (also available on my GitHub)](https://github.com/Zingo21/window_to_front) for making the window of an application appear after logging in via the web browser. 

This application was built with help from this [Codelab from Google Developers](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-github-client#0).

# This app works with:
- MacOS (Intel/M1, M2)
- Windows
- Linux
